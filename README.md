1. Design an In-Memory Cache (TTL, eviction, thread-safe)

2. Design a Rate Limiter (token bucket / leaky bucket, per-key limits)

3. Design a Circuit Breaker (closed/open/half-open, rolling window stats)

4. Design a Worker Pool (bounded queue, graceful shutdown)

5. Design a Pub-Sub (topics, subscribers, backpressure, fan-out)

6. Design a Job Queue (ack, retry, dead letter queue, idempotency)

7. Design a Pipeline (stages, bounded buffers, context propagation)

8. Design a Connection Pool (max conns, idle timeout, health checks)

9. Design a Config system (env + file + defaults, live reload)

10. Design a Logger (levels, structured logs, hooks)

11. Design an Auth middleware (JWT, key rotation, caching)

12. Design a Webhook dispatcher (signing, retries, DLQ)

13. Design an Idempotency layer (dedupe keys, replay responses)

14. Design an Outbox pattern module (db write + async publish safely)

15. Design a Repository + Unit of Work (transactions, context aware)

16. Design a Graceful Shutdown manager (signals, draining, waitgroups)

17. Design a Metrics + Health checks framework (liveness/readiness)

18. Design an Order state machine (transitions, guards, persistence)

19. Design a Payment processing module (states, retries, idempotency)

20. Design a Notification service (email/sms/push, provider failover)
